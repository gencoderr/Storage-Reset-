# tesla-microservice

> "If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search." - Nikola Tesla

This is the common basis for some of otto.de's microservices. It is written in clojure using the [component framework](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

## Breaking changes

_tesla-microservice_ is used for a number of different services now. Still it is a work in progress. See [CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md) for instructions on breaking changes.

## Features included

* Load configuration from filesystem.
* Aggregate a status.
* Execute functions with a scheduler
* Reply to a health check.
* Deliver a json status report.
* Report to graphite using the metrics library.
* Manage handlers using ring.
* Optional auto-hot-reloading of changed source files
* Shutdown gracefully. If necessary delayed, so load-balancers have time to notice.

## Examples

* A growing set of example applications can be found at [tesla-examples](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-examples).
* David & GermÃ¡n created an example application based, among other, on tesla-microservice. They wrote a very instructive [blog post about it](http://blog.agilityfeat.com/2015/03/clojure-walking-skeleton/)
* Moritz created [tesla-pubsub-service](https://bitbucket.org/DerGuteMoritz/tesla-pubsub-service). It showcases how to connect components via core.async channels. Also the embedded jetty was replaced by immutant.

### Scheduler

The scheduler wraps a thread-pool which can be used for scheduling tasks. It is based on [overtones at-at](https://github.com/overtone/at-at) project.
To actually use it you have to pass the `:scheduler` as a dependency to the component in which it should be used.
Afterwards you can schedule tasks using the overtone api like this:  
```clj
(overtone.at-at/every 100 #(println "Hello world") (de.otto.tesla.stateful.scheduler/pool scheduler) :desc "HelloWord Task")
```

The overtone-pool wrapped by the scheduler can be configured by the config-entry `:scheduler`. (See `overtone.at-at/mk-pool`)
By default the pool holds no threads.

### app-status

The app-status indicates the current status of your microservice. To use it you can register a status function to it.

Here is a simple example for a function that checks if an atom is empty or not.

```clj
(de.otto.tesla.stateful.app-status/register-status-fun app-status #(status atom))
``` 

The `app-status` is injected under the keyword :app-status from the base system.

```clj
(defn status [atom]
      (let [status (if @atom :error :ok)
            message (if @atom "Atom is empty" "Atom is not empty")]
           (de.otto.status/status-detail :status-id status message)))
```

For further information and usages take a look at the: [status library](https://github.com/otto-de/status)

## Choosing a server

As of version ```0.1.15``` there is no server included any more directly in _tesla-microservice_. 
This gives you the freedom to  a) not use any server at all (e.g. for embedded use) b) choose another server e.g. a non-blocking one like httpkit or immutant. The available options are:

* [tesla-jetty](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-jetty): The tried and tested embedded jetty.
* [tesla-httpkit](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-httpkit): The non-blocking httpkit. 

## Configuring

Applications build with `tesla-microservices` can be configured via 
`edn`-files, that have to be located in the class path.

For backwards compatibility, it is also possible to load config from `properties`-files. 
See below for noteworthy differences.
 

### Order of loading and merging

1. A file named `default.edn` is loaded as a resource from classpath if present. 
2. A file either named `application.edn` or overridden by the ENV-variable `$CONFIG_FILE`
 is loaded as a resource or, if that is not possible, from the filesystem.
3. A file name `local.edn` is loaded from classpath if present.

The configuration hash-map in those files is loaded and merged in the
specified order. Which mean configurations for the same key is overridden
by the latter occurrence.

### ENV-variables

In contrast to former versions of `tesla-microservice` ENV-variables are not
merged into the configuration.

But you can easily specify ENV-variables, that should be accessible in
your configuration:

```edn
{
 :my-app-secret  #ts/env [:my-env-dep-app-secret "default"]
}
```

ENV-variables are read with [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ). To see
which keyword represents which ENV-var have a look in their docs. 

### Configuring via properties files

For backwards compatibility, it is also possible to load config from `properties`-files. 
You'll have to pass `{:property-file-preferred true}` as a runtime config to the base-system.
It is not possible to load individual environment variables when using properties config. 
Adding `:merge-env-to-properties-config true` to the runtime config will add all system properties
and environment variables, overiding any config from files.

### Reporters
Applications utilizing Tesla-Microservice can use [iapetos prometheus client](https://github.com/xsc/iapetos) for monitoring.
Metrics are send by reporters which can be configured using the `:metrics` keyword.
Each configured reporter will start at system startup automatically.

See example configuration below for all supported reporters.

```clojure
:metrics {:graphite            {:host             "localhost"
                                :port             "2003"
                                :prefix           "my.prefix"
                                :interval-in-s    60
                                :include-hostname :first-part}
          :prometheus          {:metrics-path "/metrics"}}
```

## Automatic hot-reloading of changed source files

Restarting the whole system after a small change can be cumbersome.
A _tesla-microservice_ can detect changes to your source files and 
load them into a running server. Add this to your config, to check
for changes on each request to your system: 

```edn
{:handler {:hot-reload? true}}
```

_Note_: This should only be enabled in development mode. 
Use your `local.edn` to enable this feature safely.
You can add a `private.edn` as well for personal configurations. This file should be added to your `.gitignore`.

## Securing internal info endpoints
The Tesla-Microservice comes with endpoints that hold information about the internal state of your application.
Those endpoints can be the app-status or even metrics (Prometheus, see above).
To secure those endpoints you can provide an authentication-middleware to the base-system. 

E.g.:

```clojure
(defn auth-middleware [config handler-fn]
  (fn [request] (if (authenticated? config request) 
                  (handler-fn request)
                  {:status 401 :body "access denied"})))

(defn example-system [runtime-config]
  (-> (de.otto.tesla.system/base-system runtime-config auth-middleware))) 
```

## Addons

The basis included is stripped to the very minimum. Additional functionality is available as addons:

* [tesla-zookeeper-observer](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-zookeeper-observer): Read only access to zookeeper.
* [tesla-mongo-connect](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-mongo-connect): Read/write access to mongodb.
* [tesla-cachefile](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-cachefile): Read and write a cachefile. Locally or in hdfs.

More features will be released at a later time as separate addons.
